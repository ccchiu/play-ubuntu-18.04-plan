   Command Substitution
       Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command name.  There are two forms:

              $(command)
       or
              `command`

       Bash  performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substi‚Äê
       tution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.   Embedded  newlines  are
       not  deleted,  but  they  may  be removed during word splitting.  The command substitution $(cat file) can be
       replaced by the equivalent but faster $(< file).

       When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning except  when
       followed by $, `, or \.  The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution.
       When using the $(command) form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are  treated
       specially.

       Command  substitutions  may  be  nested.  To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes
       with backslashes.

       If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed  on
       the results.
